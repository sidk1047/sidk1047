      <td>The electromagnetic spectrum is a range of frequencies, wavelengths and photon<br>
      energies covering frequencies from below 1 hertz to above 1025 Hz, corresponding to<br>
       wavelengths which are a few kilometres to a fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus in <br>
      the spectrum of electromagnetic waves. Generally, in a vacuum, electromagnetic<br>
      waves tend to travel at speeds which is similar to that of light. However, they do so at a<br>
      wide range of wavelengths, frequencies and photon energies.<br><br></td>
